<p>College Park, MD, Feb 27, 2024 â€“ Gelectric Medical Inc., a leading innovator in medical technology, is thrilled to announce that it has been awarded a prestigious Phase II grant from the TEDCO Maryland Innovation Initiative (MII). This grant will support Gelectric Medical's groundbreaking work in developing AnastoTape, a suture-less reversible adhesive tape for anastomosis repairs.</p>
<div class="hideable-content">
<br>
<p>AnastoTape addresses a critical need in the medical field. With over 1 million intestinal anastomosis surgeries performed annually in the US and a failure rate of over 10%, there is a pressing demand for safer and more effective methods of tissue repair. Traditional sutures, while effective, come with significant drawbacks, especially in vulnerable populations.</p>
<br>
<p>Gelectric Medical's innovative solution eliminates the need for sutures altogether. AnastoTape utilizes an electrical stimulus to develop strong adhesion, offering a superior alternative to current surgical adhesives and sealants. Importantly, its reversible nature allows for easy correction in case of placement errors.</p>
<br>
<p>
"We are honored to receive this grant from the Maryland Innovation Initiative," said Leah Klein Borden, CEO at Gelectric Medical Inc. "This support will propel our mission to revolutionize surgical procedures and improve patient outcomes. We are immensely grateful for this opportunity."</p>
<br>
<p>
Gelectric Medical Inc. extends its gratitude to the MII program and looks forward to advancing AnastoTape towards commercialization, thereby contributing to the advancement of medical technology and patient care.</p>
